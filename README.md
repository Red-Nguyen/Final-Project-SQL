## Challenges 

	The data is not clear, some tables don't have PRIMARY KEY, duplicate information, and some values are not inconsistent.
	---> So, it's hard and maybe impossible to give the correct answer.

## Future Goals

	If I had more time on this data, I would spend more time on data cleaning as it is a crucial  step in data analysis.
